      <h2>Classic Tic Tac Toe</h2>
      <p>
        In Tic Tac Toe, two players alternately place their symbols (X or O) on
        a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols
        horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all nine squares are
        filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
